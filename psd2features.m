%
% The function extracts the data to be used to train the classifiers (remember to normalize the PSD e.g. with log())
%
% Input arguments:
%   - PSD_data                  [windows x frequences x channels] matrix
%   containing PSD data
%   - run_labels                [windows x 1] vector that associates a run
%   number to each windows 
%   - cue_type_labels           [windows x 1] vector that associates a cue
%   task to each windows
%   -classes                    vector containing one code for each class
%   - num_features              number of features to extract
%   - feature_weights           (optional) weight to modify the priority of
%   the features extracted with respect to their fisher's score
%
% Output arguments:
%   - selected_freq_chan_index  cell array containing the coordinates of all 
%   selected features     
%   - fisher_score_run          [freqences x channels x runs] atrix
%   containing one fisher's score matrix for each run
